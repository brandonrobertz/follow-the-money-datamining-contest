These programs were written for linux (particularly the shell scripts). Some of these might work with a slight modification with GNU coreutils for win:

You'll also need sed, wget and findutils:

I haven't tested the scripts in windows so you're on your own. If all else fails, you can copy and paste the individual lines to cmd.exe once you've installed the above.
